# Archie
personal assistant integration on Arch linux

This is a tool that can be added to normal installations of Arch to integrate a personal assistant.

It can:
- speak
- open browsers
- play music
- and more coming soon.

more tools can be added via bash scripts, and a custom voice can be added via an onnx file.

Artificial Intelligence:

The AI part of the assistant is also modular, allowing you to use an API key if available or a local instance of ollama for example.

Contribution:

Yes please help this is my first ever serious project.
